img is a simple GTK program that displays an image in a window.  It's
claim to fame is that it uses the inotify system call to monitor the
file and automatically refresh the window after any change.

usage: img [-n] filename

The -n flag means don't auto-raise the window when it is refreshed.

keyboard commands: q, CTL-c, ALT-q, ALT-w or Escape to exit
